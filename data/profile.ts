        I am a researcher and designer transitioning from a background in Architecture and Operations Research 
        into the field of AI and Robotics. My work explores the structural logic of physical environments and 
        how embodied intelligence can reason through them. By applying optimization algorithms from OR to the 
        geometric constraints of architecture, I aim to develop robots that possess a 'physical intuition' for 
        unstructured spaces. Currently, I am investigating manipulation tasks that require both high-level 
        planning and low-level tactile understanding.

        I was fortunate to be advised by 
        <a href="#" class="text-black font-medium underline underline-offset-4 decoration-1 hover:opacity-70 transition-opacity">Prof. Manish Raghavan</a> and 
        <a href="#" class="text-black font-medium underline underline-offset-4 decoration-1 hover:opacity-70 transition-opacity">Prof. Sarah Williams</a> during my master at MIT, 
        <a href="#" class="text-black font-medium underline underline-offset-4 decoration-1 hover:opacity-70 transition-opacity">Prof. Yuan Lai and Prof. Hui Wang</a> during my undergrad, 
        I completed my bachelor's degree in Architecture at Tsinghua University, where I also spent lots of my time studying Stastics and Psychology. 
        Outside of school, I enjoy tennis, skiing, building anything, and making food for friends.
