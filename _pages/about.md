Hi!üëã  This is **Yifeng Liu** [Âàò‰ºä‰∏∞].

Graduated from [SATU@Tsinghua](http://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home), I will join [DUSP@MIT](https://dusp.mit.edu/) as a master student. My experience lies in architecture design, data representation, and urban analysis. I am interested in exploring the relationship between different urban behaviors and the social/physical structure. 

I also enjoy playing rock musicüéµ and baseball‚öæÔ∏è in my spare time. Please feel free to contact me if you are looking for a bassist or a second baseman in Cambridge.üòâ
