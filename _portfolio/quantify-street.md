The continuous development of technology provides new perspectives and tools for people to recognize and analyze the city. The research team hopes to conduct research on the basic elements of urban space in combination with the new technology path method, build an interactive cognition survey website to collect the public's cognitive evaluation of street view, and sort out the correlation mechanism between street architectural interface and street view cognitive evaluation. It provides a new perspective and technical support for urban design and the improvement of urban space quality.

This study uses a crowdsourced survey-supported web-based questionnaire to collect public cognitive evaluations of the streetscape and to sort out the association mechanism between streetscape elements and streetscape cognitive evaluations. There are three main steps in our study. First, we build an interactive streetscape evaluation website to collect public perceptions of the streetscape, and then we build a machine learning model with the semantic segmentation results of the streetscape and the website evaluation results as x and y. Lastly, we tried to develop a navigation system optimized for the demand and deployed it on a website accessible through the Internet.
