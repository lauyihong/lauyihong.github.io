        I'm Yifeng, a grad student at <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu">DUSP@MIT</a>, where I merge my curiosity for people's stories with a rigorous study of urban systems and data science. My journey is a blend of different cultures and an exploration into the power of data visualization and computing to understand and improve the cities we live in.<br><br>

        As a <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">researcher</span>, I dive into the realms of computer vision and spatiotemporal analysis to decode complex urban behaviors. My work aims to harness these insights to support robust and equitable public policy frameworks. And ss a <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">designer</span>, I'm fueled by a desire to unravel human mobility patterns, enhancing civic participation and enriching urban life. My expertise includes crafting clear data narratives, developing applications, and contributing to architectural design with a focus on functionality and social impact.




        Yifeng is deeply passionate about hearing people's stories and am eager to delve into the diverse cultures around the world. His research interests encompass complex urban systems, data visualization, and the application of computing. He is now enrolling in <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu">DUSP@MIT</a> as a grad student, and eager to further his studies in the data science and urban planning fields. 
        <br><br>

        As a <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">RESEARCHER</span>, his experience accross Computer Vision algorithm development, spatiotemporal analysis. By mining complex urban systems and undiscriminating information about people's behavior, he tries to help build healthy public political systems. And as a <span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">DESIGNER</span>, he is motivated to discern patterns in human mobility, with the goal of amplifying public engagement in both our societal constructs and the built environment. My experience spans data representation, application development, and, naturally, architectural design.
