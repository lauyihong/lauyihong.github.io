        I am deeply passionate about hearing people's stories and am eager to delve into the diverse cultures around the world. My research interests encompass complex urban systems, data visualization, and the application of machine learning. Outside of my professional endeavors, I take pleasure in drawing, photography, playing the bass guitar, tennis, and baseball.<br><br>

        As an architect, I am motivated to discern patterns in human mobility, with the goal of amplifying public engagement in both our societal constructs and the built environment. My experience spans Computer Vision algorithm development, spatiotemporal analysis, urban representation, and, naturally, architectural design.
        I made sure to correct grammatical errors, provide clarity, and enhance flow.<br>


        {% include gallery caption='Part of my recent works. Explode more in my <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio!</a>' %}

        I am now enrolling in <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu">DUSP@MIT</a> as a master student, and am eager to further my studies in the computer science and urban planning fields. If anyone is interested in my work, or a band is looking for a bassist, please feel free to connect with me! <br><br>

        Hope you have a good day and thanks for your reading~
