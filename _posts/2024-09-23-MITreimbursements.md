Students should process their own reimbursements through Concur (for travel expenses) or through an RFP (local expenses such as meetings or materials).
 
Iâ€™ve attached the instructions for Concur and for RFPs. Concur reports will come directly to me since this system routes it to me for cost object approval. If you can send me a list of the students and if there are any limitations for their expenses such as what they can submit for expenses and if any maximum amount)
 
For any RFPs, you can have the students send them right to me for approval or if you want to view them first to stay within the budget you can have the students send the RFP to Yifeng and then Yifeng can send the RFP to me for approval after reviewing.
 
Whatever you decide with the RFPs just let me know.
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Best,
Janine
